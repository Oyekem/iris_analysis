Iris Flower Dataset â€“ Summary Report

Project Objective
To explore the relationships between sepal and petal features of Iris flowers and extract meaningful insights using SQL and Power BI.

Data Overview
- 150 total samples
- 3 species: Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica

Key Findings
- Petal Length is a strong differentiator between species.
- Setosa consistently has smaller petals and sepals.
- Virginica has the widest petals on average.
- Outliers were detected in sepal width for Versicolour.


Skills demonstrated:
- SQL for grouping, filtering, and summarizing numeric data
- Power BI for interactive, visual exploration
- Clear interpretation of numeric patterns and real-world framing of findings


SQL Summary
- Used 'GROUP BY' and 'AVG()' for feature summaries.
- Applied 'CASE' statements for binning petal sizes.
- Identified potential outliers using min/max ranges.


Power BI Summary
- Dashboard includes:
  - Species-wise average comparisons
  - Correlation scatter plots
  - Box plots showing variation
  - Interactive filters by species and dimension
